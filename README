#Virtual-3d-Face-Tracking

In this project, I will create a virtual 3d space using face and head tracking.To go in depth, I use the Haar Cascade face tracker
from OpenCV to determine a person's x,y,and z position relative to the webcam. I then update the display of a virtual tunnel according to the user's
position so that it gives a 3d effect.
